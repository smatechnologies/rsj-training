# Episys: Run JobFile

* This is the sub-type that is used to run Batch Jobs via RSJ.
* This calls the program **RSJ**.

![RSJ Sub-Type](../static/imgbasic/RunJobFile.png)

* **SYM Number:** The SYM# parameter is required. It tells RSJ which SYM to run the job in. The SYM number can be in either of the following formats: 000 or SYM00.
* **Episys Job:** The Job Name parameter is required. It tells RSJ the name of the Symitar Batch Job to Run.
* **Restart Point:** The restart_point parameter is optional. It tells RSJ the name of the restart point to look for tin a Symitar Batch File
* **Edit File:** The name and path to the file that RSJ will move into EDITFILE. If an Edit File is specified the Multi-Thread check box isnâ€™t available .
* **Multi-Thread Check Box:** Allows RSJ to run multiple jobs at a time. Not available if an Edit File is specified.
* **Delete Edit File Check Box:** Tells RSJ to delete the Edit File if specified after the Batch Job has run.

:::tip Best Practice

It is best practice to store the path to RSJ in a **Global Property**, 

* **RSJPath** = ```/ops/bin```

and to store the SYM### as a **Schedule Instance**,

* **SYM** = ```000```
