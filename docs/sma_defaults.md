# SMA_DEFAULTS

## What is the SMA_DEFAULTS file?

* Is stored in ```/SYM/SYM###/BATCH```
* Needs to be in **every SYM that RSJ runs jobs in**
* Holds all of the **settings** that should be **applied to EVERY job ran via RSJ**
* Is always printed in the Job Output of EVERY RSJ job
* All of the settings can be placed as a Comment in the Batch File as well

:::danger Caution

This file will be read and executed for all job files to be run. Make sure that reasonable/wanted values are set for error processing. To override these defaults for a single job, you will need to place the desired error processing commands at the start of the job file.

## Popular Settings

### CREATE_OPCON_REPORTS_LINKS 

* **Syntax**: ```;CREATE_OPCON_REPORTS_LINKS true|false```
* The default value is "true.‚Äù
* This will create symbolic links to Batch Outputs in the opcon_reports directory
* If set to false, symbolic links to Batch Outputs in the opcon_reports directory will NOT be created

### ERROR_LEVELS

* **Syntax**: ```;ERROR_LEVEL <Symitar Exit Codes>```
* The codes set will cause the RSJ to stop processing the Batch File (nested or not)
* Can be set as a Comment in the Batch File and will override what is in the SMA_DEFAULT file.

### MAX_EXCEPTIONS

* **Syntax**: ```;MAX_EXCEPTIONS #```
* The default is 0
* Is the maximum number of exceptions pages that are allowed
* If the number of exception pages goes over this limit, the job will be terminated

### JAVA_HOME

* **Syntax**: ```;JAVA_HOME <path to java>```
* Can only be set in the SMA_DEFAULTS file
* Points to where Java lives on the host

### MINUTES_TO_WAIT_FOR_EDITFILE

* **Syntax**: ```; MINUTES_TO_WAIT_FOR_EDIT_FILE #```
* The default is 10 minutes
* If the job to be executed requires an EDITFILE but  an EDITFILE exists, RSJ will wait
* If the time elapses RSJ will move the file into a temporary location as a form of backup

:::tip Best Practice

In the **SMA_DEFAULTS** files, define the following settings for RSJ:
* Create Reports Links
* Error Levels
* Max Exceptions
* Java Home Directive

**SAMPLE FILE CONTENTS**

```
;CREATE_OPCON_REPORTS_LINKS false
;ERROR_LEVEL 1-4,6,10-13
;MAX_EXCEPTIONS 999999
;JAVA_HOME "/usr/java7"
;MINUTES_TO_WAIT_FOR_EDITFILE 15
```
